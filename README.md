# Warband Banner Converter
A tool which can convert Standard Vertical Banners into the Standard Horizontal Banners   

## Usage:  
Click the Mode Choose Button to choose which mode you want to use  

## Notice:  
The warband default `banners_a.dds`, `banners_d.dds`, `banners_e.dds`, `banners_f.dds` and `banners_g.dds` are same pattern, but `banners_b.dds` and `banners_c.dds` are very messed pattern which are very different from the banners_a.dds. 
  
So if you want to replace the warband default banners, then you need to adjust them manually.
